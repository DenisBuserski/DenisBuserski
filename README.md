# Hi, I'm Denis

After 6 years in the Fitness and Health industry I decided I needed some change. Despite my successes as a Club Manager in one of the biggest fitness chains in Bulgaria, I needed something more. Even though the IT industry is completely new to me, I realized it will provide me with better and larger development opportunities. I started learning at [SoftUni](https://softuni.bg/), where I learned the basics of programming. Now I'm in the final leg of my education where I'm learning Spring Boot.
